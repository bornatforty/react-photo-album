# React Photo Album

## Description
Build a dynamic photo album using React and Redux. The homepage should feature a gallery of albums created by the owner with a preview image for each album. Clicking on the album should take the user to a gallery of images inside that particular album, and clicking on each image should point to a page that shows only that image. There should also be a sidebar navigation that allows the user to navigate to any album from the gallery page. All of this should be done through routing and not by creating hard-coded pages and links to images. The images should be hosted remotely and accessed via axios. Use React/Redux to update state and props as needed.
